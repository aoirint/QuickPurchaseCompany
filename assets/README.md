# SkipDropshipCompany

A Lethal Company mod that skip the dropship when you're on the Company or in other limited situations.

## Features

### Direct Ship Delivery

Purchased items are delivered directly to your ship instead of being delivered by dropship.

#### When It Activates

This feature activates when any of these conditions are met:

- In orbit on the first day
- While landed on the Company
- In orbit on the next day after landing on the Company, still routing to the Company (current session only)

## Credit
